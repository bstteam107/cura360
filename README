contents.

win32/		Windows NT specific files (see also wpy/ and pythonwin/)

Extensions (may be combined):

.gz		compressed with "gzip".
.tar		UNIX tar file
.exe		DOS or Windows executable
.shar		self-unpacking UNIX shell archive
.hqx		Mac BinHex 4.0
.sit		StuffIt Light(TM) Mac archive
.sea		StuffIt Light(TM) self-extracting Mac archive
.bin		MacBinary format
.html		HyperText Mark-up Language (WWW)
.el		Emacs Lisp
.ps		PostScript
.lect		Lectern display format
.zip		DOS zip archive

.tgz		== .tar.gz

You can force the ftp server to deliver gzipped versions of files,
and/or tar directories, by adding the appropriate suffix to the name
of the actual file you're fetching.  Eg, 'get README.gz' will get a
gzipped version of this file, and 'get misc.tar.gz' will fetch a
gzipped tar archive of the misc subdir.
