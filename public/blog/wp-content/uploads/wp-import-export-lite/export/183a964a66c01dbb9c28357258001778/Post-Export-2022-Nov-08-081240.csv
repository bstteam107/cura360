Those individuals who do not have full control over their hands or arms will find this to be a very beneficial feature.
Additional Benefits that Come Along with Using an Electric Wheelchair

Even though powered wheelchairs have a few limitations, the majority of those problems may be turned into benefits by spending more money or adding additional features. A motorized wheelchair does not often have the ability to fold up or dismantle. It's possible that a lot of individuals who need to travel don't have a van or another large vehicle that can accommodate their motorized wheelchairs; as a result, they'll need to figure out some other options. It's possible that you'll need to invest in an additional manual wheelchair so that you can go on trips.

Electric Wheelchair That Can Be Folded Up

Investing further money on a power wheelchair that can either be folded up or disassembled in a very simple manner would be yet another viable answer. However, the price of a foldable power wheelchair is much more than that of a normal power wheelchair. These wheelchairs are available in a variety of places.

Wheelchairs with motors function in the same way as chairs designed for use at computers. Do you feel that the power wheelchair is the most suitable choice for you? Naturally, it is depending on the specifics of your situation, including your demands and your budget. If you are able to purchase one, you will be able to take advantage of the convenience and comfort that they provide to individuals of varying ages and body sizes.",,"2022-09-13 10:00:46",post,https://cura360.com/blog/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-power-wheelchairs-cura360/,3056,,,default,"Power Wheelchair",,https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Power-Wheelchair.jpg||https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Power-Wheelchair-1.jpg||https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/EW9.jpg,Power-Wheelchair.jpg||Power-Wheelchair-1.jpg||EW9.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Power-Wheelchair.jpg||/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Power-Wheelchair-1.jpg||/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/EW9.jpg,3056||3057||3055,"Power Wheelchair||Power Wheelchair||EW9",,,,,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,advantages-and-disadvantages-of-power-wheelchairs-cura360,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-09-13 10:10:56"

<strong>Do I need a wheelchair?</strong>

However, if you are experiencing any worries about your mobility, you have probably already asked yourself this question. If you are unable to walk at all, the answer to this question is an obvious and unambiguous ""yes.""

It is probable that you would benefit from using a wheelchair if you are unable to walk for any extended period of time, need frequent to continual help from family or friends, use an assistive device such as a cane, or can only go a short distance before you feel the need to rest.

<strong>How do I choose a wheelchair size?</strong>

Finding the appropriate wheelchair size is crucial for comfort and ease of movement, particularly when using a manual wheelchair that propels itself. The chair's dimensions (from the size of the seat to the diameter of the wheels) should be suitable for the user, and it should be able to support the user's weight without difficulty.

The wheelchair's seat determines its overall design, including the dimensions of the wheel and any other detachable parts. The standard range for seat width is between 16 and 20 inches, with an average of around 18 inches.

The user's comfort and usability will be affected by the way they are sat, which is determined in part by the seat's depth. To get an accurate measurement of the seat depth, the user should sit up straight and then measure the distance from the back of the seat to the front edge.

The wheelchair's total size is determined by the dimensions of the seat, which in turn impact how easily it can be manoeuvred through narrow passageways like doors and corridors. It's important to consider the surroundings in which you'll be using your wheelchair, since factors like seat width and wheel size impact the chair's turning radius.

Wheelchairs that are foldable, lightweight, and compact feature seats that are thinner than those on regular manual wheelchairs, making them more convenient for transport and general use.

<strong>What is the difference between a transport wheelchair and a standard wheelchair?</strong>

<strong><em><u>Transport Wheelchairs</u></em></strong>

Transport wheelchairs are designed for those with mild to moderate mobility impairments who need just temporary assistance. They're easier to move around than regular chairs, weigh less, and take up less space. Its tiny wheels aren't suitable for self-propulsion, but are fine for being pushed by a carer or partner. Transport chairs are not meant for extended periods of time, therefore they are best reserved for shorter outings to places like the mall, a restaurant, or a doctor's office.

<strong><em><u>Standard Wheelchairs</u></em></strong>

Wheelchairs are constructed with smaller front wheels and bigger back wheels so that the user, if able, may drive the chair forward with little assistance from a caretaker or partner. These chairs are built to withstand regular, extended use by people with mobility impairments, so they are more sturdy, comfortable, and equipped with features like swing-away footrests and armrests.

<strong>Which are the easiest wheelchairs to push?</strong>

Due to the fact that they distribute the user's weight equally, manual wheelchairs are quite simple to propel. Wheelchairs built for travel and transport are the most user-friendly for caregiver propulsion. To facilitate transport, they employ a wheelchair with a lightweight frame, basic styling, and a small seat.

<strong>Which is the best wheelchair for seniors?</strong>

If the goal is for the senior to push themselves, the wheelchair should be lightweight, user-friendly, and simple to operate.

Seniors who use wheelchairs who satisfy these standards may enhance their mobility and keep their independence with little support from others.

<strong>Which is the best lightweight wheelchair?</strong>

The following models of lightweight wheelchairs are among the most sought for on the website Cura360.com. Each of these chairs has a weight of 55 pounds or less, and they all differ in a wide variety of other ways from one another that you should take into account while choosing the ideal one for you:

<strong>TiLite 2GK Series 2</strong>

The TiLite 2GK Series 2 is another ultra-lightweight manual wheelchair that may be modified in the same ways as the Catalyst 5. This titanium wheelchair is a more lightweight option. It has a starting weight of just 16 pounds. With just 36 areas to tweak, it falls short of the Catalyst 5 in terms of versatility. If you're searching for something lightweight and comfortable, go no further than the 2GK Series 2.

<strong>Motion Composites Veloce</strong>

When compared to our other manual wheelchairs, the Motion Composites Veloce offers one of the lowest base weights. With a starting weight of less than 12 pounds, it is one of the most portable manual wheelchair choices on the market today. The frame can be folded and carried about with little effort due to its small weight. The Motion Composites Veloce, like the preceding two, offers extensive configuration options.

<strong>Karman Flexx</strong>

As far as lightweight, adaptable manual wheelchairs go, the Karman Flexx offers the finest value. This chair folds effortlessly and provides the same advantages as a regular lightweight wheelchair, albeit having fewer customising options. Ergonomic hand grips and a movable fulcrum point are also standard features.

<strong>Karman Star 2</strong>

The Karman Star2 manual wheelchair is the lightest and most affordable option on our list; unfortunately, it cannot be customised in any way other than the size of the seat and wheels. If you are searching for a dependable basic lightweight manual wheelchair for day-to-day usage, you want to save some money, and you don't need all of the adjustable categories, then this product is still a good alternative for you to consider. It is available in a chic pearl silver hue and has a storage bag on the back of the garment. In addition, it may be folded up for easier travelling.

<strong>Features to look for when buying a wheelchair</strong>

When you go to buy a wheelchair, there are a lot of important characteristics and details that you need to evaluate and contrast to make sure that the wheelchair you choose fulfils all of your requirements.

<strong>Comfort</strong>

A wheelchair that is used continually and on a daily basis has to be comfortable, and the seat is a significant contributor to the overall level of comfort provided by the wheelchair. The vast majority of seats are fabricated from nylon or vinyl, and the degree of comfort offered by some chairs may be improved with the addition of a cushion or an individualized back support. Seat width and depth are also key aspects since they need to exactly suit the user in order to provide the highest level of comfort and the easiest mode of operation.

Cushion A cushion may be used to boost the user's comfort, stability, and support; they are often manufactured with a foam insert, but you can also acquire a gel cushion for additional comfort and support. Cushions can be purchased online. Gel cushions. Cushions. Positioning cushions can be used to correct posture and improve the user's ability to manoeuvre comfortably. Preventative cushions are a helpful solution for reducing friction and pressure sores during extended use. Positioning cushions can be used to correct posture and improve the user's ability to manoeuvre comfortably.

<strong>Seats</strong>

The majority of wheelchair seats are constructed of either nylon or vinyl since these materials are long-lasting and simple to clean. The framework and design of your gadget will determine which of the seats may be modified or updated, and you will have those options.

<strong>Seat Size</strong>

The dimensions of the seat are measured in width and depth respectively. Seat depth refers to the distance from the backrest to the front border of the seat, whereas seat width refers to the space between the left and right armrests on a particular seat.

There is a wide range of seat widths available for wheelchairs, ranging from 14 inches to 20 inches, with 18 inches being the most typical width. Seat depths are also vary and should be determined by having the person who will be using the wheelchair sit up straight in a natural active posture. This will help decide the seat depth that is most suitable for that person. The majority of websites devoted to mobility equipment retailing provide configurable choices for seat width and depth within the product specs section of their sites.

Height of the Seat The height of the seat is determined by how much the bottom of the seat is elevated off of the ground. Wheelchairs often have a seat height that ranges from 20 to 21 inches, which is suitable for people with a height of at least 5 feet. If the user is shorter than 5 feet, transferring may be problematic because the seat height of the wheelchair will be too high; thus, it is essential to choose the seat height that is appropriate for you.

<strong>Chair Dimensions</strong>

The height of the chair refers to the total height of the wheelchair, measured from the ground to the highest point of the chair. This may have an effect on the chair's agility from a structural standpoint, but in a more practical sense, it dictates how readily the chair can be stowed, moved, and driven by a partner or carer.

<strong>Weight of the Chair</strong>

If you often need to carry your chair or are shopping for a wheelchair that will be simple for you to control while you are travelling, then the total weight of the wheelchair is going to be an essential element for you to take into consideration. The typical starting weight for lightweight wheelchairs is one pound, but this number may rise to as high as sixty-five pounds based on the modifications and accessories that are added to the chair. Manual wheelchairs are often a great deal lighter than motorized wheelchairs.

Armrests The wheelchair user receives an increased level of comfort as well as support from armrests. They are often detachable or have the ability to be flipped up in order to facilitate simpler transit and transfer. The height of many armrests, either at a table or at a desk, makes it possible for them to be tucked away neatly beneath a typical table-top surface.

Leg Rests Much like armrests, leg rests are designed to provide the user a higher level of support and comfort for their legs. They are available in a wide range of designs, but the most essential aspect to take into account is whether or not you want the legs to be able to swing or adjust, since this might have an effect on how easily the chair can be moved.

Wheels The chair's movement may be made more stable and convenient with the addition of wheels. Wheels Because the majority of wheels are composed of rubber or are semi-pneumatic, the rolling characteristics of the wheelchair may be altered depending on the terrain. Some of the most long-lasting wheel alternatives do not need any kind of care, while others do, since their wear and tear over time requires them to be changed at regular intervals.

<h3><strong>Is a 3 wheel or 4 wheel mobility scooter better?</strong></h3>
The primary distinction between a mobility scooter with three wheels and one with four wheels is, in most cases, that a mobility scooter with three wheels is mostly utilised for indoor purposes due to its smaller size in comparison to a mobility scooter with four wheels. When it comes to navigating uneven and unclear terrain, a mobility scooter that has three wheels is equipped with smaller wheels that provide less resistance than larger wheels. Whereas a four-wheel mobility is designed to be driven in outside environments, which gives it the ability to easily go across uneven terrains and unpaved surfaces. When compared to a 3-wheel mobility scooter, this one's larger tyres provide more sustainability, and its larger battery covers a greater distance.

<strong>3-Wheeled Mobility Scooters</strong>

The capacity to easily navigate tight spaces is the key advantage offered by 3-wheeled mobility scooters. When compared to their four-wheeled counterparts, three-wheeled scooters have a turning range that is more acute. Additionally, due to the compact base of these vehicles, they are able to perform effectively in tighter bends. This particular model works well both in the home and in the workplace. In comparison to other models, three-wheelers get a higher score given the assumption that you are looking at one that can be transported. When it comes to folding, three-wheel mobility scooters fold into a more compact more folds into a more conventional shape, and when it comes to disassembly, the components are lighter and change into less disassembled pieces.
despite the fact that it was planned and constructed to be 100% safe and stable. Mobility scooters with three wheels are considered less steady in comparison to those with four wheels. The fact remains that having four wheels at each corner provides more stability and reduces the risk of the vehicle rolling over in adverse conditions.
People who are taller or who have longer legs need more leg room, and 4-wheel scooters give greater leg space than 3-wheel scooters do. People who have longer legs also require more leg room. Because there is only one wheel in the front position, 3-wheel mobility scooters have a base that is rather small. Therefore, those who have lengthy legs may experience feelings of confinement or irritability.

<strong>4-Wheeled Mobility Scooters</strong>

A 4-Wheel Mobility Scooter is loaded with improved and updated capabilities that may be used both inside and outside of the home. On dirt roads and conditions, you should feel completely at ease when steering the car. People who are seeking for an option that combines increased legroom and seat size with a high level of comfort will find that this is the best option. This particular kind of the Model C comes with a variety of characteristics, such as seats that can be adjusted for height, backrests, and armrests that can be adjusted and cushioned to provide additional comfort.
A 4-wheel scooter will typically provide enough space for the rider's legs, will go at a respectable speed, and will also have an adequate battery life. Individuals who want to use the vehicle for lengthy periods of time on a regular basis should consider purchasing one of these since it is equipped with high-capacity motors and tyres. It is more comfortable while offering improved durability and stability. Because of its bigger size, it is less manoeuvrable than a three-wheeled scooter; nevertheless, it can be disassembled into lightweight components that can fit in the storage or trunk of your vehicle. This results in a little increase in storage space requirements.
Things to consider before buying a Mobility scooter whether it is a 3-wheel or a 4-wheel

<strong>Maneuverability</strong>

Mobility scooters with three wheels often include a steering system that is less in weight. As a direct consequence of this, directing these scooters is a lot less difficult. In point of fact, the turning radius is often up to 10 inches tighter than that of a mobility scooter with four wheels.
Having said that, it is essential to examine the environments in which you will most often utilise the scooter. A three-wheeled scooter is ideal for usage in tight quarters since it is more manoeuvrable than a vehicle with four wheels.

<strong>Travel Terrain</strong>

In general, mobility scooters with three wheels are more appropriate for use indoors, whilst scooters with four wheels are more appropriate for use outside.
Because of their little size and space-saving design, three-wheeled mobility scooters are often more suitable for usage indoors. In addition, three-wheeled scooters often have smaller wheels, which provide less rolling resistance than larger wheels. In contrast, four-wheel scooters often have bigger wheels, which allow them to go over rougher terrain and provide them a greater range of motion.
On the other hand, there are some three-wheel scooters that have very huge wheels, and other four-wheel scooters that have very tiny wheels. You have the option of purchasing a three-wheeled scooter that is better able to handle harder terrain if you want to go that route.

<strong>Balance</strong>

Because they include an additional wheel, mobility scooters with four wheels ultimately provide a higher level of stability. People who have trouble maintaining their balance might benefit from using them more than other options.
Patients with bariatric conditions who have difficulty walking could benefit from using a four-wheeled scooter, for instance. These patients will benefit from the increased stability, which will assist support them.
<strong>Legroom</strong>
Legroom is increased with three-wheeled scooters since there is only one wheel at the front of the vehicle. Having said that, those who are taller or who are suffering from an injury to their leg or knee may benefit from using this model.

<strong>Price</strong>

Generally, 3 wheel scooters are less expensive than 4 wheel scooters.
When it comes to mobility scooters, one of the deciding factors regarding what to buy, and a matter that is frequently debated about, is which to choose: 3-wheeled scooters or 4-wheeled scooters. We will look at the advantages and disadvantages of each.

<strong>Advantages of 3 Wheel Mobility Scooters:</strong> 3- wheel mobility scooters are equipped with 2 wheels at the back and one at the front. Due to the narrow base in the front and small in size, these scooters are excellent to maneuver in tight spaces. Due to their low turning radius capability they are very good for indoor activities and to maneuver around furniture. Three wheelers are also lighter in weight and are not as expensive as four wheelers. When compared to four-wheel mobility scooters, they have more legroom and are therefore ideal for people who are taller or who suffer from knee or leg injuries or ailments.

<strong>Disadvantages of 3 Wheel Mobility Scooters:</strong> Even though many three-wheel mobility scooters have wheels designed to prevent them from tipping over, the stability of these scooters is not as good as that of four-wheel models. In addition, they perform the best when utilised on even and smooth surfaces, as opposed to uneven and rugged outdoor surfaces such as grass or gravel.

<strong>Advantages of 4 Wheel Mobility Scooters:</strong> Mobility scooters with four wheels are constructed similarly to automobiles, with two driving wheels in the rear and two steering wheels in the front of the vehicle. This design provides increased stability for traversing a variety of terrains, including gravel and curbs, thanks to its layout. When compared to three-wheel scooters, four-wheelers provide more stability across whatever terrain they travel on, regardless of whether they are used inside or outside. Because they have four wheels, they are less likely to topple over, even while travelling at peak speeds, and they are better able to manage inclines and bumps than the majority of three-wheelers. Because of the four-wheel configuration of these mobility scooters, their turning radius is typically greater than that of the majority of three-wheel mobility scooters. As a result, these mobility scooters are not as manoeuvrable as most three-wheel mobility scooters, and it is not recommended that they be used primarily inside.

<strong>Disadvantages of 4 Wheel Mobility Scooters:</strong> due to the fact that these kinds of mobility scooters have a layout that includes four wheels. Because users of mobility scooters require a great deal of balance and arm strength to steer it, the mobility scooter is not appropriate for persons who have significant impairments or mobility issues. Some of the models are far too large to be readily transported or stored. This is not a smart choice for houses or flats that are on the smaller side. The user is able to do the majority of the activities that are found inside thanks to the lower turning radius offered by some of the smaller four-wheel scooters. The four-wheeled versions of three-wheeled scooters are more expensive and come with a few extra pounds of additional weight.",,"2022-09-15 11:51:19",post,https://cura360.com/blog/do-people-prefer-3-wheel-or-4-wheel-mobility-scooters/,3074,,,default,"Mobility Scooter","Mobility Scooter",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mobility-scooter-cura360-for-blog.jpg,mobility-scooter-cura360-for-blog.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mobility-scooter-cura360-for-blog.jpg,3074,"Mobility Scooter - cura360",,,"Mobility Scooter - cura360",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,do-people-prefer-3-wheel-or-4-wheel-mobility-scooters,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-09-15 12:38:31"

Gels are an excellent choice for mitigating heat because, even after prolonged application, their temperature is maintained at a comfortable level. In spite of the fact that they are a little bit heavier than the various other cushion alternatives, they are an excellent option with a price that falls somewhere in the center of the range, and they are the cushion of choice for any advanced positioning requirements.",,"2022-09-19 11:32:01",post,https://cura360.com/blog/are-you-interested-in-purchasing-a-replacement-cushion-for-your-wheelchair/,3080,,,default,"Wheelchair Cushion &amp; Seating",,https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roho-cushiion.webp,roho-cushiion.webp,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roho-cushiion.webp,3080,"roho cushion",,,"roho cushion",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,are-you-interested-in-purchasing-a-replacement-cushion-for-your-wheelchair,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-09-19 11:34:03"

3087,"Benefits of Rehab Walkers","Walkers and rollators are two types of mobility assistance devices that may help people who have trouble getting about to have more flexibility and independence in their daily lives. People who have suffered injuries or impairments, as well as senior citizens, are at a heightened danger of falling, which is why many of these individuals choose to use walkers rather than other forms of locomotion while moving about.

<strong>Different classifications of walkers</strong>
Walkers, which are often referred to as Zimmer frames, have a stable metal structure with four legs and are used to assist those who have difficulty walking. The majority of walkers are constructed with a frame that has three sides and completely encircles the user. The user grasps each side of the frame, raises it over their head, and positions it farther in front of them before taking the next step forward to meet the walker. There are various distinct categories of walkers, including the following:
<strong>Rollators</strong>
They have a seat, hand grips, and a frame that has four wheels attached to the bottom of it. The user is not responsible for raising the whole of the walker; rather, they are responsible for propelling it forward. As a standard safety precaution, the vehicle has been outfitted with hand brakes.
<strong>Knee walker</strong>
The knee walker, also known as a knee scooter, is a mobility device that is similar to a rollator. However, unlike the rollator, the knee walker allows the user to rest their knee on a cushion while using their other, stronger leg to drive themselves forward.
<strong>A combination of a Walker cane and a cane</strong>
It is a hybrid between a cane and a walker and combines the best features of each. It differs from a conventional cane in that, rather than having a whole frame, it just has two legs. This allows it to provide additional support.
<strong>Advantages accrue to those who take walks</strong>
Walkers have been the mobility aid of choice for older people for many decades, and the use of walkers has increased by almost fifty percent over the course of the last decade. Many individuals would be unable to move about freely in their own houses and would also be unable to leave their homes in the event that they did not have access to rehabilitation walkers. Your loved one will have a greater degree of independence, a decrease in the amount of discomfort they are experiencing, and an improvement in their level of self-esteem if you get them an adult walker that is now available for purchase. Added to it are the following additional advantages:
<strong>Safer Walks</strong>
Those who suffer from conditions such as arthritis or injuries to the leg or hip may find it difficult to keep their balance and may even topple down. It's possible that the best option for them would be to invest in a four-wheel walker that has wheels measuring 8 inches in diameter. This would allow them to move more safely. When using a walker, an individual has a lower chance of falling, regardless of whether they are strolling around their home or around their neighbourhood. Since the rollator can go up stairs, the user can now get to parts of the house they couldn't get to before.
<strong>Longer Walks</strong>
Walking is recommended for people who have sustained injuries almost exclusively because it assists them in regaining strength, resilience, endurance, and balance. When using a walker, the user will put the majority of their weight on the frame of the device. This will allow the user to walk over greater distances and for a longer period of time without experiencing discomfort. The walker provides the user with additional support and bears part of their weight, reducing the strain that is placed on their body.
<strong>Possession of the Capacity to Take a Break When Necessary</strong>
While out for a stroll, the user may feel the urge to stop and rest for a while so that they may catch their breath. The user of a walker often has access to a padded seat on the device, which allows them to rest and recoup their strength while using the device. The user may sit down on the seat to prevent themselves from falling when they get fatigued, making the seat an important component of the overall safety system. This function is both useful and important for the health and well-being of most users.

Huge wheel walkers for sale are the top options for most individuals who are seeking mobility assistance. This is because large wheel walkers for sale are both practical and cheap for people with disabilities. They also come with a multitude of advantages, some of which have already been highlighted.

It might be difficult to choose the proper mobility walking aid device for yourself or for a family member or friend who needs assistance with walking. This is true of all walking aid devices. There are a lot of different aspects to think about, such as how stable and comfortable the gadget is, where and how it will be used, how strong the user is, and other things like that. The product specialists at Cura360 are more than delighted to assist you in selecting the rollators and walkers from our extensive inventory that are most suited to meet your individual requirements.

3096,"How to Properly Disinfect Your Mobility Devices","While life is slowly getting back to normal from the COVID-19 pandemic, facilities are opening again as more and more citizens are being administered the vaccine. However, it is still important to remain vigilant on cleanliness.  Keeping your mobility devices such as wheelchairs, power wheelchairs, mobility scooters, seat cushions and walkers, clean is not only restricted to prevention of further covid spread but to keep all types of germs at bay–not to mention maintaining good working order of your product. Here we will cover some proper device sanitization techniques to keep your device clean and in good working order.
<ul>
 	<li>Start in a well-ventilated area, away from others that may be around.</li>
 	<li>Wear a mask to avoid inhalation of any cleaning products, as well as use gloves–disposable nitrile gloves or any household gloves will work.</li>
 	<li>Use a disinfectant spray* (most any from your local grocery store will work) and a clean terry cloth.</li>
 	<li><strong>Perform a spot check!</strong> Spray a bit onto a very small spot on your device and wait for a moment. Use the cloth to wipe down the spot and wait another moment–make sure there is no discoloration or visible corrosion.</li>
 	<li>Once it’s determined that the spray is safe to use on your device, lightly spray your entire device (note: avoid spraying directly onto any LED displays or electrical controlls.) Use your towel to carefully wipe and dry everything.</li>
 	<li>Use this cleaning process when you feel your device has been around many people, such as crowds or busy sidewalks.</li>
 	<li>Some areas may need a bit more attention if there is dust or dirt in areas near the wheels.</li>
</ul>
By following these steps, you can ensure your device will be sanitized and ready to use again around the general public. Not only will it help keep you away from germs, it will help those around you as well! Happy cleaning!

*Be sure to read your owner’s manual before using cleaning products as some devices may have restrictions on the type of cleaner used.

3103,"Custom power wheelchairs offer comfort and mobility","The vast majority of people who rely on <a href=""https://cura360.com/power-wheelchairs"">power wheelchairs</a> do not have the financial means to acquire additional wheelchairs or to replace their existing wheelchairs on a regular basis. Getting the correct mobility equipment is important because it assures your comfort and makes your day-to-day life simpler for a longer amount of time. Getting a customised power wheelchair is an investment that is worth making because of this.

Your primary care physician or a <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physical-therapists.htm"">physical therapist</a> will be able to guide you through the process of selecting a mobility aid that is appropriate for your long-term requirements. Even if you are presently able to get about with the help of a scooter, your doctor may suggest that you invest in a power wheelchair as soon as possible if the underlying cause of your mobility issue has the potential to cause your condition to worsen over time. If you know that you are going to need a mobility device in the near future, it is more cost effective to get a power wheelchair now rather than a power scooter now and then purchase another mobility device in the future.

If you are planning on changing the mobility equipment you are now using, it is important to make a list of the difficulties you are currently encountering with your mobility. When you begin your search for a new wheelchair, one of your first priorities should be to determine what customization options are now available to help reduce the difficulties you have encountered. If you have difficulties putting your feet into the correct position or reaching high shelves, you may want to consider purchasing a power wheelchair that has footrests that raise and lower automatically or a lift seat. Create a list of the challenges you are presently facing, and then look into purchasing a motorised wheelchair that can help you overcome those challenges.

The requirements of your lifestyle will also play a role in determining the sort of powered wheelchair that best suits your needs. Where exactly do you carry your wheelchair when you leave the house? If you are able to drive yourself, have a wheelchair van that is specifically designed for transporting wheelchairs, and do not often need to transport your wheelchair in a vehicle or on an airline, the wheelchair's weight is not as significant of a consideration. Folding motorised wheelchairs are meant to be lightweight and easy to dismantle, making them an ideal option for wheelchair users who will be travelling by flight or in vehicles that are not specifically built to accommodate wheelchair passengers. The components are easily transportable by a physically capable individual due to their low weight and their ability to be folded down into a smaller size, hence reducing the amount of space required for storage in baggage.

You have the ability, thanks to the customizable wheelchairs that come with a variety of optional options, to make your wheelchair not only more convenient but also as pleasant as is humanly possible. Seats that have the ability to headrest or recline may be fitted, and if you use a wheelchair with a power base, you have the option of choose from a variety of seats. You have the option of adding extra cushions, which, in addition to making the seating arrangement more comfortable, may help prevent or cure pressure sores. It is possible to connect a drink holder to wheelchair bags and caddies, which also allow you to carry personal goods. However, the most majority of power wheelchairs only come in two colours: blue and red. Some models give you the option to choose from a range of colour schemes, but in most cases, you are limited to just those two hues.

3106,"Which Is the Better Choice: a Walker or a Rollator?","<strong>Buying a Walker or Rollator</strong>

There is a common misconception that rollators and walkers are the same things, but in truth, they are two distinct forms of medical equipment. In spite of the fact that they both help people with mobility challenges walk more easily, the two approaches use quite different approaches to accomplishing this goal. This article will discuss what considerations should go into a choice on whether an adult should buy a walker or a rollator.

<strong>Adult Walker</strong>

Supports made of aluminium were used in the construction of this apparatus. Its primary characteristic is that, in order for it to work correctly while being carried, it must be raised, pushed ahead, and then set back down after each step. It is not as easy to manoeuvre as a rollator, however many versions come with wheels that make it much simpler to manoeuvre while using it. In comparison to a rollator, it offers superior support and has a lower price point, but it cannot be transported as easily.

<strong>Types</strong>

Adult walkers typically come in one of two varieties: with wheels or without wheels. The wheel type of walker features caster wheels positioned at the bottom of them, which assist the walker glide while it is being pushed by the user, providing for a smoother ride overall.

<strong>Bariatric</strong>

Bariatric products are designed for those whose weight is much higher than the typical weight of the population as a whole. In most cases, the weight capability of walkers ranges from 250 to 350 pounds. A bariatric walker is an alternative to consider in the event that either you or a member of your family weighs more than the conventional walker's weight capacity. Its dimensions will be somewhat increased, and it has the potential to support much more weight—in certain cases, up to 600 kg.

<strong>Speciality</strong>

In addition, there is the option of using a specially designed walker. There are two types of rollers available: posterior safety rollers and anterior rollers. These are for those who have difficulty walking with a standard walker. These rollers were developed specifically to assist persons who suffer from illnesses or conditions that cause pain in the rear region while they walk in using them. These walkers are designed to assist individuals in maintaining their balance and walking in a straight manner.

<strong>Different Rollators</strong>

A regular walker is somewhat similar to a rollator, however, a rollator often has additional components such as a seat, wheels, a basket, a brake, and so on. The simplicity with which one may use a rollator in comparison to a walker is the primary benefit of using one. Rollators have an ergonomic design that makes walking a smoother action, letting the user glide across the ground easily without much effort. Rollators are often available in a range of colours and are meant to seem in vogue and sophisticated because of how popular they are.

<strong>Three-wheeled Rollator</strong>

Rollators with three wheels are often more compact and provide improved manoeuvrability in confined areas. Some individuals say that they are more fashionable and that they appear better than four-wheeled rollators (only an opinion). It comes standard with a bag that is connected to the front and may be used to hold small personal belongings.

<strong>Assisted mobility devices with four wheels.</strong>

The four-wheeled rollator is bigger than the two-wheeled rollator and, as its name suggests, it has four wheels, which provides for a more steady driving. The stability provided by a four-wheel walker might be advantageous if you live in a rural setting, on a farm, or in another location with a lot of grass and dirt. The four-wheeled rollator often has a basket that is bigger and has the capacity to hold more objects, as well as a seat that is mounted to the rollator as standard equipment.

<strong>Easy on the Stomach</strong>

When you have to push anything for a significant distance, one of the most important considerations is how much it weighs. If you want to use your rollator rather often, you should probably consider investing in a model that has a lower overall weight. The term ""lightweight"" refers to a rollator that has been constructed to have as little of an impact on the user's ability to move around as possible. This is typically accomplished by constructing the rollator out of steel alloys that are lighter in weight and by decreasing the size of various components. These rollators typically weigh between 25 and 60 percent less than their respective equivalents. When a burden is lighter, it is much simpler to move and manoeuvre about. If you or a loved one has problems with carrying huge weights or weariness, or if you simply want a walker that is lightweight and easily portable, then a ""low weight rollator"" is the right choice for you.

<strong>Bariatric</strong>

As is the case with walkers, there is also a bariatric version of the rollator. Again, if you or someone you care about weighs more than 300 pounds, the bariatric version of the rollator is going to be the most comfortable option.

<strong>Which Is Better: a Walker or a Rollator?</strong>

Should you invest in a walker or a rollator instead? That, of course, is dependent on the particulars of your own life. If you feel comfortable walking while using an adult walker, then I believe it is the best option for you. They are often less expensive than rollators, and you also have the option to purchase wheels for them, which may make it much easier to move about while using the product. However, if you struggle with exhaustion or weakness, want fashionable walking assistance, carry a lot of stuff, want the opportunity to sit anywhere and at any time, or simply want a smoother ride, then a rollator would be the ideal choice for you.",,"2022-09-23 10:59:41",post,https://cura360.com/blog/which-is-the-better-choice-a-walker-or-a-rollator/,3107,,,default,"Walking Aids","rollator,walker,walker and rollator",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rollaor-walker-cura360-e1663930766445.jpg,rollaor-walker-cura360-e1663930766445.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rollaor-walker-cura360-e1663930766445.jpg,3107,"rollaor walker - cura360",,,"rollaor walker - cura360",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,which-is-the-better-choice-a-walker-or-a-rollator,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-09-23 10:59:41"
3113,"Lightweight Manual Wheelchair","How It May Be Able to Assist: Focusing on the Lightweight Manual Wheelchair

You will likely hear from a good number of individuals claiming they do not need any assistance in moving about. One thing is for certain, though, and that is the fact that having some assistance in the form of an item such as a lightweight manual wheelchair comes in quite helpful. If the wheelchairs are excessively heavy, it may be difficult for handicapped people to move about very much, and even if they do move around, they often get weary quite quickly. The reason for this is that they were using very heavy wheelchairs as opposed to lightweight ones when they made their observations. Why limit your time spent outside of the home to just a few hours each day when you have the ability to wander aimlessly all day and all night if that is what you really choose to do? You will be able to do this task with the assistance of the lightweight manual wheelchair.

Additionally, the lightweight manual wheelchair may be folded up in a manner that makes it simple to stow away in the trunk of a vehicle. This indicates that getting into and out of the automobile in order to visit a variety of shops is not as much of a challenge as it might otherwise be. It is possible that you may have a great deal of annoyance if the wheelchair is bulkier than others, or if it is an electric kind that cannot be transported or stored as readily as lightweight wheelchairs.

But why are lightweight wheelchairs so much lighter than their predecessors' versions, and what exactly is it about these wheelchairs that makes this difference? In most cases, there is nothing more to it than the kind of metal that is used, which is often titanium or aluminium. These are the kind of materials that will result in the least amount of weight that has to be transported. The lightest chair of the heavier versions weighs twenty-eight pounds, whereas the lightest chair of the earlier, lighter types weighs just fourteen pounds. The lightest chair among the lightweights weighs only fourteen pounds. This makes a significant impact, particularly for the one who spends the whole day putting it and taking it out of the trunk of their vehicle. It also makes a difference for the one who is responsible for physically wheeling the chair around.

You will notice that a handicapped person does not feel weary as soon as a healthy person does, and as a result, they have the energy to do a greater number of activities during the day. They have an easier time getting about the home, and they can even take a trip around the shopping centre if they want to. You will want to make sure that you have a lightweight manual wheelchair that will enable you to get to wherever it is that you want to go if you want to be independent and be able to travel about on your own. This will allow you to go anywhere you want without the assistance of another person.",,"2022-10-03 11:30:09",post,https://cura360.com/blog/lightweight-manual-wheelchair/,3114,2022-10-04,,default,"Manual Wheelchair",,https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/manual-wheelchair-cura.jpg,manual-wheelchair-cura.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/manual-wheelchair-cura.jpg,3114,"manual wheelchair cura",,,"manual wheelchair",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,lightweight-manual-wheelchair,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-10-04 11:31:03"
3116,"Folding or rigid wheelchair","Rigid Wheelchairs are made up of a one-piece frame. Due to their overall design, and materials, rigid wheelchairs are extremely lightweight.
A folding wheelchair comes with a foldable feature, which involves folding the wheelchair seat and components into a smaller shape, which provides significant storage space savings and may be conveniently stored in the trunk of a vehicle.
Do you feel confused between selecting folding and rigid wheelchairs? Here are some points to consider while choosing between Folding and Rigid Wheelchair
One of the most common questions that come up frequently is Folding versus Rigid wheelchairs. Let’s discuss both sides today.
<strong>1. Configuration-</strong>
Folding Wheelchair- They have a traditional cross-brace that collapses in half by pressing the sides together. With a scissor brace, chairs can be folded from the front and back, rather than from the sides.
Rigid Wheelchair- Rigid wheelchairs were developed as modifications to sports wheelchairs. The lighter weight and structure enable users to push with much less effort. Rigid wheelchairs are often divided into two types- the monotube, which uses a single tube to provide a softer ride, and the box frame, which includes a second support bar to enable more energy conservation.
<strong>2. Weight</strong>
Materials are simply one thing to consider when it comes to the overall weight of your chair. The weight of the wheelchair should be the most important factor to be considered while looking for a wheelchair. Before buying it, make sure you are aware of the components available in that weight. Frame materials should be chosen based on their weight, strength, and durability.
Titanium has a high strength-to-weight ratio, which means it gives a lighter frame weight and has a longer service life, due to its resistance to bending damage and corrosion.
Aluminium is more economical. Greater steps have been made in order to increase the strength to produce a lighter weight frame. It will require an additional coating to achieve the same level of corrosion resistance as Titanium.
Carbon Fiber is the most recent addition to the wheelchair market which is a lightweight, durable material that resists corrosion. They are more expensive to manufacture due to the difficulty in shaping them. It lacks the same resistance as other materials and therefore has a higher risk of damage if dropped.
<strong>3. Style of Frames</strong>
Rigid manual wheelchair frames come in two different frames. One has a ""monotube,"" which is a single continuous tube that leaves the chair's bottom open and makes it easier to bring closer and across the body to transfer into the car. Naturally, the frame's weight is lowered with less tubing. Titanium can be used in a monotube style that can provide a softer ride, but it may also take energy from the push, which may result in energy loss. Others enjoy this ""drive"" because it is more pleasant, or it has a favourable effect on reducing tone or pain when propelling the chair.
Rigid frames normally feature a ""fixed front end,"" which means it does not move out of the way for standing transfers; rather, search for a single side ""flip-up"" footplate that opens the chair's front region for transfers. Once the footplate is lifted, the leg rests may swing away in some circumstances. It's crucial to remember this and test this frame to ensure it'll work for you. ""Quick release axles,"" like folding frames, make it simple to remove the wheels. Canes that ""fold-down"" to make the frame smaller may usually be ordered back to help in transferring the frame into a smaller boot or vehicle.

3119,"Smart Tips for Choosing the Right walker and Rollator","People who have been disabled for an extended period of time and have experienced a loss of strength and stamina may find that using a rollator is the ideal answer for their mobility issues. Some of these walkers are equipped with convenient and cutting-edge features that are designed to make the user's experience more comfortable. These walkers also come equipped with height adjustments, making them suitable for a wide range of users. Additionally, there are various types available that come equipped with features such as a storage bin and a holder for the sticks, which may be used to store a variety of different goods. Nevertheless, in order to get a rollator that is suitable for you, there are a few things that you need to take into consideration:

<strong>Take into consideration the Objective</strong>

The reason you intend to acquire them is the single most significant factor that you have to take into consideration before making a purchase decision. These walkers are primarily designed for those who have mobility challenges that are expected to last for an extended period of time, such as the elderly or disabled. If a person is having temporary difficulty going from one room to another, they should consider purchasing traditional walkers rather than rollators. Rollators may be cumbersome.

<strong>Wheel Construction and Variations</strong>

In general, there are two distinct kinds of wheels available for these, and these are the normal rubber wheels as well as the inflated wheels. However, the sort of wheels that are most appropriate for a person is dependent on the application that they have in mind. If a person needs them for terrain that are uneven and rough, the ones that are inflatable would perform best for him. The majority of the time, customers may choose between models with either three or four wheels. These are the primary variants.

<strong>The Degree of Protection and Effortlessness</strong>

The sort of walker that a person intends to purchase is a significant factor in determining the amount of convenience and security that can be provided by the device. Hand brakes are an essential component of those that come equipped with seats and must be included in order to maintain users' safety and ensure correct operation. Additionally, many people choose to purchase models with additional wheels since this might improve mobility, but it can also reduce the degree of protection offered.

<strong>Take into consideration your height</strong>

Walkers come in a variety of heights; thus, if you are a person who is taller than average, you need to be sure that you are purchasing a walker that is the appropriate height for you. While you are walking beside them, it is imperative that your body does not twist in any way. Additionally, it is important for those of shorter stature to choose walkers that likewise have a lower overall height.

<strong>Comfort Level</strong>

People who value their comfort should look for chairs that are cushioned before making a purchase decision. Some of them also come with a back support, which is a feature that makes a significant contribution to lowering the level of tension. Keep in mind that rollators that only have three wheels do not come with seats; thus, if you want the convenience of a seat in addition to the other amenities, you will need to look at rollators that have four wheels.",,"2022-10-06 10:20:15",post,https://cura360.com/blog/smart-tips-for-choosing-the-right-walker-and-rollator/,3120,,,default,"Walking Aids","rollator,rollator with seat,walker,walker and rollator",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rolator-cura360.jpg,rolator-cura360.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rolator-cura360.jpg,3120,"rolator cura360",,,"rollator cura360",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,smart-tips-for-choosing-the-right-walker-and-rollator,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-10-06 10:20:15"

3135,"Tips to consider while selecting a cushion","Wheelchair cushions are an inevitable part of any transportation set up for seniors and the elderly. The primary thing that comes to mind of a wheelchair user is comfort, however, a wheelchair cushion is considered more than just comfort. It provides benefits that are beyond just comfort. Including positioning, and pressure management which can reduce fatigue and enhance their balance throughout the day. Since everyone’s sense of comfort is not the same, considering different factors to get the perfect-fitted cushion is essential for you.

Read further to know some helpful tips for choosing an apt cushion for you.

To ensure that the cushion you are purchasing is safe and desirable, keep these factors in mind while you are shopping around.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Friction</strong>- Proper friction between your clothes and the cushion cover is essential for your safety. There should be a proper and adequate amount of friction as too little friction will make it hard for you to transfer from your chair, whereas too much friction can be a perilous situation as you can quickly slide off the cushion.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cushion Shape</strong>- While deciding on a wheelchair seat cushion shape, it is more important to take into consideration the user’s mobility and medical requirements. There are four most popular wheelchair cushion shapes that are available, which are- saddle-shaped wheelchair cushions, pommel-shaped wheelchair cushions, wedge-shaped wheelchair cushions, and anti-thrust wheelchair cushions. Choosing the appropriate shape can prevent skin breakdown as well.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cushion Material</strong>- There are three most popular wheelchair cushion materials types that are- foam, gel, and air. The material of the wheelchair can have a larger impact on the comfort of the user. All the materials have their own upsides and downsides. Choosing the right one as per your requirements may be confusing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Life expectancy</strong>- Most the cushions generally last two- to five years, except for foam cushions, which have a shorter life span. To get the right one for you, you need to check how long will your cushion last.</li>
 	<li><strong>Moisture Control</strong>- A cushion should keep you dry and prevent sweating as sweat builds up on your skin and it makes your skin more wet which is more suspectable to damage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Temperature Control</strong>- Your cushion should be able to absorb heat which can be beneficial for people who spend most of their time in their wheelchairs. The cushion which is made up of gel or thermoplastic urethane stays cool and reduces any kind of heat build-up and allows air to circulate so you stay cool and dry.</li>
</ol>
Above listed are some major considerations to look forward to while purchasing one perfect fit for you.

3225,"Finding the Perfect ROHO/Air Wheelchair Cushion for You","Wheelchairs may be outfitted with a variety of cushions, some of which are more unique and innovative than others. One such cushion is the ROHO/Air cushion, which is now on the market. These cutting-edge cushions have an air cell block design, which when inflated, effectively disperses pressure and prevents skin degeneration caused by extended wheelchair use. Both of these conditions are brought on by using a wheelchair for an extended period of time.

Although each ROHO and Air cushion utilises the same fundamental air cell architecture, this is achieved in a number of different and distinctive ways depending on the design. Because of this, choosing the best ROHO/Air cushion needs taking into consideration a number of the cushion's properties in addition to the many options that are available.

This article will make the process of choosing a ROHO/Air wheelchair cushion as easy and stress-free as possible for you by guiding you through the most important features and benefits to search for when making your purchase.

ROHO has committed its resources to the research, development, and manufacture of air-cell-based cushions with a design that has been awarded a patent and is known as DRY FLOATATION® technology over the period of more than 45 years. This technology has been given the name DRY FLOATATION®. It simulates the attributes of water and ensures that an individual's body is immersed and enveloped to give optimum pressure distribution. This is achieved by imitating the properties of water. This is made possible by the fact that it is able to imitate the characteristics of water. It is possible for the user's air cells to be adjusted to meet their changing shape and condition thanks to the modular design, which helps to maintain blood flow and minimises pressure on contact areas.

ROHO cushions provide varied degrees of support, ranging from modest help for everyday comfort to high-level support for the treatment and rehabilitation of pressure injuries. ROHO cushions are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. They are available in a wide range of sizes and styles to accommodate a broad spectrum of consumer physiques as well as individual tastes and preferences.

3229,"The Best Wheelchairs on the Market for Seniors in 2022","For people with disabilities, the degree to which they are able to move freely and independently is one of the most important indicators of their quality of life since it dictates how they engage with the world around them. Around 3.2 million people who would otherwise be unable to move around freely or have difficulty doing so are able to do so with the assistance of a wheelchair, whether it be a motorised or manual one. It is common knowledge that looking for the right wheelchair, whether for oneself or for a member of one's family, can be a highly stressful process for the one doing the looking. After all, there are hundreds of various sorts, and there is a wealth of diversity among their characteristics.

When you go out to buy a wheelchair, one of the first questions you should ask yourself is whether you need a manual or motorised wheelchair. This will help you narrow down your options. People with disabilities that are not as severe, people who are more active, or people who have injuries that are only temporary may find that they are more comfortable using manual wheelchairs. On the other hand, people who have disabilities that are very severe or people who require additional assistance may find that they benefit from using an electric wheelchair. However, in addition to these factors, there are others that need to be taken into consideration, such as the weight of the chair, its capability of being folded, its mobility, and the degree of comfort it provides.

<strong>So, Can You Please Explain What a Wheelchair Is?</strong>

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines wheelchairs as ""technology that enable a person with a mobility impairment to move about either inside or outdoors, or both."" Wheelchairs may be used both indoors and outdoors. As their names indicate, wheelchairs are essentially chairs that have been adapted in such a way as to add wheels. The kind of propulsion that is used to push a wheelchair places it in one of two categories: manual operation or power-driven. Wheelchairs may be placed in either of these categories.

<strong>Who Can Take Advantage of the Possibility to Use a Wheelchair If It Is Available?</strong>

People who are unable to walk due to an illness (physiological or physical), an accident, or a disability are the target population for wheelchairs. Those who have difficulty walking or are unable to walk altogether are also included in this target demographic.

<strong>Wheelchairs That Are Controlled With The User's Hands</strong>

The individual who is seated in a manual wheelchair is the one who moves it forward by pushing on the bars that ring each of the larger wheels of the chair. This is done in order to move the chair. This enables the chair to move forward, which in turn leads the user to be propelled forward. The wheelchairs each come equipped with grips on the back, allowing two persons to simultaneously propel the chair forward. The overwhelming majority of wheelchairs that are powered manually may either be of the standard or lightweight kind.

<strong>Standard wheelchairs</strong> are the kind of wheelchairs that cost the least; nevertheless, there is a trade-off for the affordability of these chairs. Standard wheelchairs are not as comfortable as other types of wheelchairs. These wheelchairs have a weight capacity of more than 36 pounds, which makes it more challenging to manoeuvre and push them than other models that weigh less. Standard wheelchairs are often manufactured from materials that are lower in cost, and some people find that sitting in them is uncomfortable. Because of all of these factors, we do not advise using ordinary wheelchairs for extended periods of time or on a consistent basis.

Wheelchairs that are classified as lightweight, as their names suggest, weigh much less than standard wheelchairs. These wheelchairs have a weight that is lower than the standard, which is 36 pounds, and they weigh less than that. The majority of versions are equipped with extra cushioning for the user's comfort as well as an adjustable back, footrests, and armrests. Some examples of lightweight versions of wheelchairs include the following:

<strong>Wheelchairs with high strength and low weight</strong> — These chairs are more long-lasting than either the ordinary or lightweight wheelchairs, yet at the same time they weigh less than a typical wheelchair would (about 30-34 pounds). Persons who desire to go out often and have an active lifestyle are the ones who will benefit most from wearing them.

The lightest kind of wheelchairs, known as ultra-lightweight wheelchairs, come in at a little under 30 pounds. These wheelchairs are the lightest kind of wheelchairs. In addition to this, they are the ones that are the least difficult to command. It's possible that those who are confined to a wheelchair for extended periods of time may discover that ultra-lightweight wheelchairs provide a higher level of comfort.

The term ""transporter chair"" refers to yet another kind of mobility chair that is typically included in the same category as wheelchairs. Transporters are mobility aids that are comparable to wheelchairs but also have the manoeuvrability of walkers or rollators. Rollators and walkers are other names for transporters. These transporters are incapable of self-propulsion since they are equipped with four smaller wheels rather than two bigger wheels, which would allow them to go forward on their own. As a consequence of this, they are intended to be pushed by a carer rather than by the individual who is using them.

<strong>The Diverse Types of Electric Wheelchairs Available Today</strong>

Wheelchairs that are propelled by electric means and are attached to a power source are referred to as power-driven wheelchairs, electric-powered wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs, or powerchairs. Other names for these types of wheelchairs are powerchairs and electric-powered wheelchairs (typically motors and batteries). Wheelchair propulsion methods may be broken down into three main types, which are as follows:

Wheelchairs that have front-wheel drive are built with two large driving wheels in front of the seat and two smaller casters in the rear for both stability and movement. Front-wheel drive wheelchairs are the most common kind. The most popular kind of wheelchair is one that drives on the front wheels. These chairs have the capability of moving over bumps and obstructions that are up to 2 inches in height. These have the capacity to fishtail when turning at high speeds and have the ability to turn with the smallest turning radius of any drive system.

These wheelchairs are quite comparable to front-wheel drive wheelchairs; however, the structure of the wheels is inverted, with two large driving wheels located closer to the back of the seat and two smaller casters located in front of the seat. These wheelchairs are designed for individuals who have limited mobility in their front or back legs. Wheelchairs with rear-wheel propulsion provide a high degree of stability and are simple to handle, even while travelling at high speeds. In addition to this, they are less likely to be oversteered and are the power wheelchairs that are most suited for use outdoors, especially on uneven terrain.

There are a total of six wheels on these chairs, which are known as ""central drive"" chairs. There are two large driving wheels located at the centre of the seat, two smaller wheels at the front of the chair, and two smaller wheels at the back of the chair. These chairs feature a turning radius that is noticeably less than the turning radius of the other two drive systems, which makes them ideal for use in interior spaces that are more compact and outdoor places that are level. They are also a viable option for usage in bigger outdoor areas. These wheelchairs, on the other hand, have a propensity to sink into softer ground and lose their grip when they do so. They are also more difficult to manoeuvre, and in general, they are designed for individuals who need a wheelchair with a big weight capacity, up to 600 pounds. They are designed for persons who require a wheelchair with a large weight capacity, up to 600 pounds. In addition to this, transporting them is more challenging.

Despite the fact that these three categories of vehicles are often confused with one another, there are some essential differences between power wheelchairs, electric scooters, and mobility scooters. One of the most recognisable characteristics of motorised wheelchairs is the presence of a joystick that acts as the main way of control for the device. This not only allows the user to exert less arm or hand force while maintaining the same level of control, but it also provides support for the user's arms. Joysticks are simple controls that just need a light touch from the player's fingertip to activate. Handlebars are used to steer electric scooters, which necessitates a much higher level of upper-body power from the rider.

<strong>Is Medicare Responsible for Paying for Wheelchair Coverage?</strong>

Due to the fact that wheelchairs fall under the category of durable medical equipment, Medicare Part B will pay for their purchase. However, in order for Medicare to pay for wheelchairs, the user's treating physician needs to provide a written order stating that the patient needs a wheelchair in their home and has met all of the requirements for limited mobility that Medicare stipulates. Only then will Medicare pay for the wheelchair. Once the conditions for the patient's Part B deductible have been met, the patient is responsible for paying 20% of the Medicare-approved cost, while Medicare covers the remaining 80% of the cost. It's possible that some Medical Advantage plans' all-inclusive benefits packages may extend coverage to wheelchairs as well.",,"2022-10-29 07:10:39",post,https://cura360.com/blog/the-best-wheelchairs-on-the-market-for-seniors-in-2022/,3067,,the-very-best-wheelchairs-currently-on-the-market-for-senior-citizens-in-2022,default,Wheelchair,"best lightweight wheelchair,lightweight wheelchair,lightweight wheelchair foldable,lightweight wheelchair for sale,wheelchair",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/manual-wheelchair-cura360.jpg,manual-wheelchair-cura360.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/manual-wheelchair-cura360.jpg,3067,"Buying Guide manual wheelchair - cura360",,,"manual wheelchair - cura360",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,the-best-wheelchairs-on-the-market-for-seniors-in-2022,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-11-01 10:59:08"

3243,"Choosing the Right Treadmill for You","<h4>Type of Treadmill</h4>
The first kind of treadmill we'll discuss is the <strong>manual treadmill</strong>. You don't need to be a health and fitness expert to realise that a manual treadmill does not have a motor. It's just a straightforward piece of equipment with a belt and some rollers that you have to move by hand. The less complicated an apparatus is, the lower the probability that anything will go wrong with it. Therefore, this is a quality to its favour, since it will endure for a longer period of time. The fact that the treadmill's belt doesn't move by itself means that you can select your own speed, which is great for those who are motivated to push themselves but not so great for folks who are naturally sluggish.

The next option is a <strong>motorised treadmill</strong> that has capabilities that allow you to choose the speed at which you walk, jog, or run. You are able to choose the needed tempo for yourself and maintain it over a period of time in order to obtain the most effective workout possible from the time you spend on it. Then there are the 'inclination' settings, which are available on certain motorised treadmills; they may assist you in determining the degree of incline that you desire for your run. It's a difficult piece of technology, thus the solutions to its intricate issues are complicated as well. However, the pros outweigh the downsides in this situation. In addition, a motorised treadmill is going to be more costly than a manual treadmill, but with those qualities, you need to select for what you are looking in a treadmill.

You can no longer use the excuse that you don't have room for a treadmill since <strong>foldable treadmills</strong> have rendered that justification obsolete. Treadmills that fold up take up an insignificant amount of room while they are stored. When you take a break, whether in the workplace or at home, they are wonderful to have on hand and utilise. If you are unable to commit to a regular workout routine due to time restrictions or because you just lack the motivation to do so, a treadmill that can be folded up may be the most suitable solution for you.

Your age as well as your current weight are important aspects that will play a role in determining which option is best for you. Although there are others who believe that physical activity is essential for everyone, the kind of activity that one engages in should be modified in accordance with the characteristics of the person. Check the specifications before making a purchase since a person with a large frame could need a bigger belt, or the handlebars can get in the way of the natural motion of the arms. Age is a factor in the decision-making process, and particularly for seniors, factors such as the durability of the deck and the ability to regulate heart rate are critical considerations. It is imperative that you should not skimp on safety measures since they are beneficial for people of all ages. In a similar vein, the peak speed you need from your treadmill as well as the size of the belt will be different depending on whether you want to run or walk when using it.

When you become aware that you need to increase your fitness levels, one of the first things you do is seek for a treadmill. However, the kind of treadmill you need is determined by your goals and objectives. If you want to shed as much fat as possible in a reasonable amount of time, experimenting with the inclination settings on the treadmill is not a terrible idea at all. Again, interactive heart rate checks come in quite helpful to help you achieve your optimal level of physical fitness without causing any harm to your body. The question of ""Who will be using it?"" is just as important as the question of ""How will you use it?"" If you buy a treadmill with the intention of improving the physical health of your entire family, then you should take into consideration any impediments that might prevent a family member from making full use of the treadmill. There is a good chance that if you are prepared to spend a sufficient amount of money, you will be able to find a treadmill that will fit a wide variety of people like a glove.

Your treadmill has to have a motor that is appropriate for the length of your workouts, whether they are short or long. It's possible that the treadmill's ""high duty"" setting isn't as worthless as you first believed it to be if you use it in short spurts. Because the treadmill is only able to keep it going for a certain amount of time, this limitation may be one factor that helps keep the cost of your treadmill in check.

How often do you make use of it? Your selection of exercise gear need to be influenced by the intensity of the workouts that you want to do on your treadmill. The more you plan to use the treadmill, the more strongly we suggest that you invest in one of the higher quality models. In the long term, the cost of repairs will bring the difference in price between low-end and high-end treadmills to a point where it is no longer significant. Since of this, it is recommended that you get a high-quality treadmill that has a higher price tag as opposed to purchasing a low-priced treadmill because the latter is likely to need more visits from the repairman than it does from you.",,"2022-11-02 13:37:22",post,https://cura360.com/blog/choosing-the-right-treadmill-for-you/,3244,,,default,Fitness,treadmill,https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/312RuIyrNvL._AC_SY780_.jpg,312RuIyrNvL._AC_SY780_.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/312RuIyrNvL._AC_SY780_.jpg,3244,treadmill_Cura360,,,treadmill_Cura360,,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,choosing-the-right-treadmill-for-you,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-11-02 13:37:22"
3246,"How to Assess Your Needs and Choose the Right Kind of Walker or Rollator","Before you can choose a specific model, you will first need to make a decision in a broader sense on whether a walker or a rollator is more suitable for you. Only then will you be able to narrow down your options. For additional reading, please take a look at our page on ""All About Walkers and Rollators.""

<strong>1. Can be used either indoors or outdoors, and must meet certain stability requirements</strong>

In what areas do you believe you could benefit the most from some assistance? The type of walker or rollator that is best suited to fulfil your demands will be determined, in large part, by your requirements.

Utilizing a conventional walker that does not come equipped with wheels will provide you with the most amount of support as well as stability. When using it, walking is significantly slowed down, and constantly repositioning the walker can be tiresome; as a result, it is recommended that it be used only indoors or for short distances. Two-wheel walkers allow for a more natural stride, in spite of the fact that they provide less support and stability than standard walkers do. Rollators, on the other hand, are less effective and less stable than two-wheel walkers. Two-wheel walkers provide far more support and stability than standard walkers do. They are also superior alternatives that might be utilised outside in natural settings.

If you want to use the rollator indoors the majority of the time and are considering purchasing one of these devices, you should go for a kind of rollator that has smaller wheels. When assessing whether or not the rollator will fit through the entrances in your home, it is important to take the proportions of those doorways into consideration. It is possible that you will lose an additional two inches from the entryway if the door hinges. When looking for a rollator, you should make sure that it can be manoeuvred easily down the hallways and into the individual rooms. When shopping for a rollator to use outside, look for one that has wheels with a diameter of at least 8 inches. Wheels that have a greater diameter are better suited to handle terrain that is uneven. Rollators that only have three wheels are easier to steer and steer in tight spaces than those that have four wheels, but they are less stable. If you need more support while walking long distances or if you need to stop and rest frequently while you are out and about, a four-wheeled rollator may be the ideal option for you. If this describes your situation, read on.

<strong>2. If necessary, modifications to the wheelchair, walker, or rollator</strong>

Before you make the purchase, you must ensure that a walker or rollator can support your height as well as your weight in order to know for certain that it will fulfil your requirements. In order for you to be successful in this endeavour, you will need to take precise measurements. You are able to verify the weight capacity of things online to make certain that they can support your weight in the suitable manner and that they are able to do so appropriately. You can measure yourself at home, or you can go to a dealer's showroom where they can measure you and allow you try on a range of various models. Measuring yourself at home is one option, but going to a dealer's showroom is another.

<strong>To measure the height of the handle, do the following:</strong>

I always try to keep a healthy posture by standing up straight and letting my arms dangle by my sides. I hope this helps!

ii) Have a second person measure your height from the ground all the way up to the crease that is seen on the inside of your wrist. Your shoulders and arms should be in a relaxed position while you are holding on to the grips of the walker, and your elbows should be bent at an angle of 15 degrees.

It is crucial to take measures of the seat's height and width before acquiring a rollator with a seat to ensure that you will be able to sit in comfort once you have the seat in your possession.

3. <strong>Grips</strong>
If you want to make using a walker or a rollator more pleasurable for yourself, one of the most important things you can do is check to see if the device has grips that are sized appropriately for your hands. This is true regardless of which equipment you decide to use. The most majority of them come with grips made of plastic; but, if you have hands that sweat a lot, you might find that a grip made of a softer material is more comfortable for you to use. People who suffer from arthritis or any other condition that inhibits their ability to grasp may benefit from utilising broader grips. This is also true for people who suffer from conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. When you're using rollators, your hands need to be able to comfortably grip the grips, but they also need to be able to easily activate the brakes without exerting too much force.

Drive a medical rollator with this control handle.
Talk to an occupational therapist about the grips that you could use that would be the most comfortable for you to use, or test them out in the showroom of a dealer to get a better idea of how they would feel in your hands.

<strong>4. Portability in addition to being able to be stowed away</strong>

If you have a restricted amount of space in your home or if you frequently travel by car, investing in a walker or rollator that can be folded up quickly and simply may prove to be more useful for you. Even people with less dexterity in their hands won't have any trouble utilising the one-button, two-button, paddle, or trigger folding systems that are available on some walkers. These systems can be found on different types of walkers. If you don't hear or feel a ""click"" when you unfurl the walker, you should give it a quick test to make sure that it is locked in place. If it is, you can proceed with unfolding the walker. If you don't hear or feel the component ""click"" into place, you should give it a quick test to make sure it is secured. In order to put the walker in the trunk of a car, you will need to have the ability to fold it up and to be able to lift it.

Rollators that have three wheels usually weigh less and can be folded into a more compact form when they are not in use. A rollator or walker that can be folded up could be more easy to store in homes or apartments with limited space when it is not being used because it takes up less room.",,"2022-11-04 11:50:18",post,https://cura360.com/blog/how-to-assess-your-needs-and-choose-the-right-kind-of-walker-or-rollator/,3247,,,default,"Walking Aids","walker and rollator",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/banner-22-1200x800-1.jpg,banner-22-1200x800-1.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/banner-22-1200x800-1.jpg,3247,"Cura360 Walker and Rollator",,,"Cura360 Walker and Rollator",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,how-to-assess-your-needs-and-choose-the-right-kind-of-walker-or-rollator,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-11-04 11:50:18"
3250,"The best 10 criteria to use when picking out a wheelchair","<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">1.</span></strong> A piece of mobility equipment known as a wheelchair may be helpful for those who are unable to walk due to an illness, an injury, a disability, or just advanced age. These persons benefit greatly from the use of wheelchairs since it simplifies their mobility. There are many different kinds of wheelchairs available, including manual wheelchairs, power-driven wheelchairs, electric scooters, and electric wheelchairs that are pushed by electricity.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">2.</span></strong> The vast majority of wheelchairs are created with the intention of assisting their users in navigating familiar environments such as their homes, schools, and places of employment. On the other hand, there are other wheelchairs that are designed for more leisurely pursuits. Recreational wheelchairs are often bigger than conventional versions, and they may come with a variety of extra amenities in addition to normal arm rests, footrests, and storage compartments.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">3.</span></strong> Wheelchairs are custom-made by their makers to correspond with a user's unique proportions. Before purchasing a wheelchair, you should take your own measurements if you want to ensure that it will fit you well. You may figure out how much room you need between your knees and hips by sitting in a wheelchair and measuring the distance using a tape measure.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">4.</span></strong> When choosing a wheelchair, consider the following factors:

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">• Comfort</span></strong> - How pleasant is the experience of sitting on this chair? Is it comfortable to sit on for an extended period of time? Does it give the appropriate amount of support for the back?

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">• Durability</span></strong> - How long will the wheelchair remain functional? Will it hold up under the rigours of everyday use?

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">• Mobility</span></strong> - What kinds of movement are available while using the wheelchair? Is it able to travel uphill, downhill, over curbs, and other obstacles?

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">• Safety</span></strong> - Does the manual wheelchair come with any kind of built-in safety features? Are they up to date with the standards?

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">5.</span></strong> After you have settled on the kind of wheelchair that best suits your needs, the next step is to choose a location in which to store it. The majority of wheelchairs are foldable and portable, meaning that they can be quickly stowed away when they are not in use. Some of them are stationary, which means that they do not fold up at all and need a fixed location in your house to be used.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">6.</span></strong> Check out the wheelchair's warranty first before making the purchase. In general, manufacturers will provide warranties that last anywhere from one year to ten years. Check to see that the warranty from the manufacturer covers both repairs and replacement components. Additionally, seek for a warranty that covers the cost of delivery for free.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">7.</span></strong> If you plan to buy a wheelchair online, take note of the return policy. Some companies allow you to return a product without paying a fee, while others charge a small fee. Be sure to read the fine print carefully before making a purchase.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">8.</span></strong> Choose a type of wheelchair that is up to date with the latest safety regulations to ensure your comfort and wellbeing. Check the frame of the wheelchair for any damage such as cracks, corrosion, or other issues. Keep an eye out for wheels that are solid and won't come off when they are banged.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">9.</span></strong> If you want to use your wheelchair outdoors, you should check to see that it has brakes before you leave the house. When someone presses the brake pedal, the wheelchair is prevented from moving forward because the brakes are engaged.

<strong><span style=""color: var(--lblue);"">10.</span></strong> If you use a wheelchair that you have to push yourself, you will require training on how to do it correctly. To begin, you will need to learn how to push and control the wheelchair. After that, get into the habit of moving about your home. Last but not least, you may try moving the wheelchair down ramps and stairs.",,"2022-11-08 05:40:32",post,https://cura360.com/blog/the-best-10-criteria-to-use-when-picking-out-a-wheelchair/,3143,,,default,Wheelchair,"best lightweight wheelchair,Electric wheelchairs,lightweight wheelchair,manual wheelchair,manual wheelchair price,motorised wheelchairs",https://cura360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cura360-Kona-Wheelchair-e1666175081703.jpg,cura360-Kona-Wheelchair-e1666175081703.jpg,/home/cura/public_html/public/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cura360-Kona-Wheelchair-e1666175081703.jpg,3143,"cura360 manual-Wheelchair",,,"cura360 manual-Wheelchair",,,,,,,,,publish,1,admin,bstteam110@gmail.com,Test,Team,the-best-10-criteria-to-use-when-picking-out-a-wheelchair,,,default,,,,open,open,"2022-11-08 05:40:32"
